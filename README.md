Nubank Report
=============

An adroid application that captures notifications from the Nubank app and 
creates a report that can be sent by email and easily added to a spreadsheet.

This may be helpful for people who uses spreadsheets to control their finances (like me).

This app is also being developed as a learning experience in Android development. :)

Roadmap:
- Listen and capture/parse Nubank notifications (FINISHED)
- Google account login for email export
- Email export for the report
- Timed Reminders for purchases report export
