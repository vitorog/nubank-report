Nubank Report
=============

An adroid application that captures notifications from the Nubank app and 
creates a report that can be sent by email and easily added to a spreadsheet.

This may be helpful for people who uses spreadsheets to control their finances (like me).

This app is also being developed as a learning experience in Android development. :)
